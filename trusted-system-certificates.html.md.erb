title: Configuring Trusted System Certificates for Applications
---

The following mechanisms exist to provide trusted certificates to applications running on Cloud Foundry:

- For the `cflinuxfs2` stack, you can install the trusted certificates directly into the system trust store at `/etc/ssl/certs`. In the deployment manifest, set the `cflinuxfs2-rootfs.trusted_certs` property of the `cflinuxfs2` release's `cflinuxfs2-rootfs-setup` job to the concatenated values of the PEM-encoded CA certificates. 
<br><br>
For example:
<pre>
properties:
  cflinuxfs2-rootfs:
    trusted_certs: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      (contents of certificate #1)
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      (contents of certificate #2)
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
</pre>

- You can also present trusted certificates to all application instances, including those based on Docker images and those on Windows. 
<br><br>
To do so, provide the concatenated PEM-encoded CA certificates in the `diego.rep.trusted_certs` BOSH propert on `rep` and `rep_windows` jobs for the Diego release, or in the global properties section of the deployment manifest. 
<br><br>
The individual certificates in this property appear as separate files in the `/etc/cf-system-certificates` directory. 
<br><br>
For example:
<pre>
properties:
  diego:
    rep:
      trusted_certs: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        (contents of certificate #1)
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        (contents of certificate #2)
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
</pre>
