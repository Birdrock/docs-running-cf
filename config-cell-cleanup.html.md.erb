<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to configure Disk-Cleanup scheduling
on Diego Cell Virtual Machines (VMs)
in Cloud Foundry (CF).

## <a id='what'></a> What is Disk-Cleanup

CF isolates application instances (AIs) from each other
using containers that run inside Cells.
Containers enforce a set of isolation layers
including file system isolation.
A CF container file system can either be
a CF stack
or the result of pulling a Docker image.

For performance reasons,
the Cells cache the Docker image layers and the CF stacks
that running AIs use.
When CF destroys an AI (e.g.: as a result of `cf delete`)
or when CF reschedules an AI to a different Cell,
there is a chance that certain Docker image layers,
or an old CF stack
will become unused.
If CF does not clean these unused layers
the Cell ephemeral Disk will slowily fill.

Disk-Cleanup is the process of removing unused layers
from the Cell Disk.
The Disk-Cleanup process will remove all unused Docker image layers
and old CF Stacks,
regardless of their size or age.

## <a id='options'></a> Options for Disk-Cleanup

CF provides the following options
for scheduling the Disk-Cleanup process
on Cells: 

* **Never clean up the Cell Disk**:
  We do not recommend using this option
  for production environments.
* **Routinely clean up the Cell Disk**:
  This option makes the Cell schedule a Disk-Cleanup
  every time a container gets created.
  Running the Disk-Cleanup process so frequently
  may have a negative impact on the Cell performance.
* **Clean up Disk space once a threshold is reached**:
  Choosing this option makes the Cell schedule the Disk-Cleanup process
  only when a configurable Disk space threshold is reached or exceeded.

### <a id='recommendations'></a> Recommendations

Choosing the best option for Disk-Cleanup depends
on the workload that the Cells run:
Docker images or buildpack-based apps.

For CF installations that mainly run **buildpack-based applications**
we recommend using the second option:
**Routinely clean up Cell Disk space**. 
The **Routinely clean up Cell Disk space** option ensures
that when a new stack becomes available on a Cell,
the old stack is dropped immediately from the cache.

For CF installations that mainly run **Docker images**,
or both Docker images and buildpack-based apps,
we recommend using the third option:
**Clean up Disk space once a threshold is reached**
along with a reasonable threshold.
Choosing a threshold is described in
[Choosing a Threshold](#choosing-a-threshold).

### <a id='choosing-a-threshold'></a> Choosing a Threshold

To choose a realistic value when configuring the Disk-Cleanup threshold,
you must identify some of the most frequently used Docker images
in your CF installation.
Docker images tend to be constructed
by creating layers over existing, base, images.
In some cases, you may find it easier
to identify which base Docker images are most frequently used.  

Follow the steps below to configure the Disk-Cleanup threshold:

1. Identify the most frequently used Docker images or base Docker images. 
<br><br>Example: The most frequently used images in a test deployment are `openjdk:7`, `nginx:1.13`, and `php:7-apache`.

1. Using the Docker CLI, measure the size of those images.
<br><br>
Example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    \# Pull identified images locally
    $> docker pull openjdk:7
    $> docker pull nginx:1.13
    $> docker pull php:7-apache

    \# Measure their sizes
    $> docker images
    REPOSITORY       TAG          IMAGE ID          CREATED             SIZE
    php              7-apache     2720c02fc079      2 days ago          391 MB
    openjdk          7            f45207c01009      5 days ago          586 MB
    nginx            1.13         3448f27c273f      5 days ago          109 MB
    ...
    </pre>

1. Calculate the threshold as the sum of the frequently used image sizes plus a reasonable buffer such as 15-20%.
<br><br>
Example: Using the output above, the sample threshold calculation is (&nbsp;391&nbsp;MB&nbsp;+&nbsp;586&nbsp;MB&nbsp;+&nbsp;109&nbsp;MB&nbsp;)&nbsp;*&nbsp;1.2&nbsp;=&nbsp;1303.2&nbsp;MB

## <a id='applying-configuration'></a> Applying the Disk-Cleanup Scheduling confiuration

There is a single BOSH property that controls the Disk-Cleanup scheduling:
`garden.graph_cleanup_threshold_in_mb`.
It receives the following values:

* `-1` to **Never clean up the Cell Disk**.
* `0` to **Routinely clean up the Cell Disk**.
* A positive number to **Clean up Disk space once a threshold is reached**.
  The provided number is the threshold.
  <br><br>
  Example: As calculated in the previous step,
  you would set the BOSH property to **1303**.

If you are deploying CF with [GrootFS](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/grootfs-release)
then please configure
the `grootfs.graph_cleanup_threshold_in_mb` option instead.
